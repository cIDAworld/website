# The cIDA official website


## Introduction

This guide provides you with all the information needed to update and maintain content for the [cida website](https://websitemain23451.gtsb.io/). The only folder that you have to focus on is [src/content](./src/content). Inside that folder you will find 6 sub-folders that contain content for the different website sections:

- **about:** the *About* section 
- **hero:** the full-screen image (called a hero image in webdesign) and caption that you see on the landing page 
- **logos:** a collection of logos that are used throughout the website
- **members:** the *Members* section 
- **projects:** the *What's On* and *Archive* section. When content expires it automatically moves from What's On to *Archive*
- **publications:** the *Publications* section


### Markdown 
Written content is saved in markdown files. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a simple language for creating formatted text. Markdown files usually end with a `.md` extension. The most important things to remember about markdown syntax are: 

- *italic text* is achieved by placing an asterisk before and after the text you want to be italicised, e.g. `*italicised text*`
- **bold text** is achieved by pacing two asterisks before and after the text you want to be bold, e.g. `**bold text**`
- ***italic and bold text*** is achieved by placing three asterisks before and after the text that you want to be bold and italicised, e.g. `***bold and italicised text***`
- links are written in the form `[name of the link](URL that you want to link to)` for example `[Link to Google](https://www.google.co.uk/)` will result in [Link to Google](https://www.google.co.uk/)
- images are included in the form `![Alt text](path to image "title")` for example `![An image of a cute cat](readme_pics/cat.jpeg "Cute kitty")` will result in ![An image of a cute cat](readme_pics/cat.jpeg "Cute kitty")<br>Cute Kitty<br>You should always include a short description of the image in alt text to make your website accessible
