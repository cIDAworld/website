I teach political theory at the Department of Government, University of Essex, where I am co-director of the Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis. Adopting a discourse analytic and psychoanalytic approach to social and political analysis, my research engages broadly with theories of ideology, political economy, and democracy, seeking to delimit a field of investigation I call critical fantasy studies. I am especially interested in the role fantasy can play in helping us understand our affective investment in a wide range of discourses and organizational practices, and to draw out the ideological, political and normative implications of such analyses. The ‘logics approach’ to social and political analysis I have developed with my colleague David Howarth is partly informed by this interest in affect and fantasy, and runs alongside it. A product of sustained engagement with key debates in the philosophy of social science the logics approach operationalizes important insights of the Essex School of Discourse Theory - and poststructuralism more generally - for the conduct of critical empirical research. Grounded in our monograph Logics of Critical Explanation in Social and Political Theory, we argue that this approach helps draw out in a rather forceful way the ideological, political and normative significance of practices.
