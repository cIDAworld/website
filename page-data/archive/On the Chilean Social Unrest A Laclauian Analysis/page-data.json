Looking in particular at the\nconstruction of the people and the antagonistic frontier, this session will analyse how the\nChilean mobilizations have not found a representative, leader, or signifier that embodies the\nset of unsatisfied citizen demands and that allows them to be translated into concrete social\npolicies or an alternative political project.</p>\n<p>Date: 18th November 2022</p>\n<p>Time: 4.30 - 6pm UTC</p>\n<p>Dr. Camila Vergara is a critical legal theorist, historian, and journalist from Chile writing on the relation between inequality, corruption, and domination, and how to institutionally empower common people to resist oppression from the powerful few. Currently, she is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Cambridge conducting research on plebeian constitutional rights. Vergara has published academic articles on corruption and populism in peer-reviewed journals as well as contributed opinion pieces on neoliberalism and the popular uprising in Chile for Jacobin Magazine and Sidecar—New Left Review. She holds a PhD in Political Theory with specialization in Constitutional Law from Columbia University, and has taught political theory courses at New York University, Columbia University and Universidad Diego Portales. Currently she teaches an open-access class in the Escuela Popular Constituyente on Youtube to guide Chileans during the ongoing constitutional process.</p>","fields":{"hasPassed":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"On the Chilean Social Unrest – A Laclauian Analysis by Camila Vergara","date":"Friday, 18 November 2022","endDate":null,"time":"4.30-6pm UTC","place":"NTC.1.02, University of Essex","category":["event"],"pdf":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/f0a7d/onthechileansocialunrest.png","srcSet":"/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/9b8b7/onthechileansocialunrest.png 274w,\n/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/95592/onthechileansocialunrest.png 548w,\n/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/f0a7d/onthechileansocialunrest.png 1096w","sizes":"(min-width: 1096px) 1096px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/5cc8f/onthechileansocialunrest.webp 274w,\n/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/34ac6/onthechileansocialunrest.webp 548w,\n/static/e10927fad3543efbe78846b0aa61dfa2/df5d5/onthechileansocialunrest.webp 1096w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1096px) 1096px, 100vw"}]},"width":1096,"height":1096}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/On the Chilean Social Unrest A Laclauian Analysis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["114927166","2103793815","2997459007"]}
