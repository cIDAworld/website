Developing themes presented in a recent book - Logics of Critical Explanation in Social and Political theory (which was co-written with Jason Glynos) - I begin by accepting Connolly’s view that we bring various ethical and normative commitments to our interpretations of problematized phenomena, thus endorsing Nietzsche’s perspectivism, but I then add a little more to Nietzsche’s ‘perspective seeing’ by outlining three logics – social, political and fantasmatic - which I argue are indispensable in helping us to explain, criticize and evaluate. On the way, I contrast Connolly’s commitment to a Spinozist/Deleuzian philosophy of immanence, with a more Derridean and Heideggerian inspired philosophy of weak transcendence.</p>","fields":{"hasPassed":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pluralizing Methods: Contingency, Ethics, and Critical Explanation","date":"Tuesday, 1 July 2008","endDate":null,"time":null,"place":null,"category":["working paper series"],"pdf":{"publicURL":"/static/3ea8920b1136c3fba8340cf515792768/Howarth (2008) Pluralizing Methods.pdf"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/6a2b5/pluralizingmethods.png","srcSet":"/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/4b9bd/pluralizingmethods.png 410w,\n/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/25d40/pluralizingmethods.png 820w,\n/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/6a2b5/pluralizingmethods.png 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 1640px) 1640px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/4be23/pluralizingmethods.webp 410w,\n/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/f3568/pluralizingmethods.webp 820w,\n/static/0c1b1e9e7165e7b8bdadc2abb112c808/23b8d/pluralizingmethods.webp 1640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1640px) 1640px, 100vw"}]},"width":1640,"height":1640}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/pluralizinfmethods"}},"staticQueryHashes":["114927166","2103793815","2997459007"]}
