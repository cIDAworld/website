The Tartu-Moscow Schoolâ€™s notion of the semiosphere and the notion of discourse of the Essex School are crucial for that framework. Both are seen as deeply relational or trans-actional conceptions of systems of meaning that is constitutive of political action and social reality in general. The talk is focused on bringing out how these conceptions mutually complement each other for better conceptualization and empirical research of power, governance and democracy as certain articulations of social and political reality.</p>\n<p>Peeter Selg is professor of political theory at Tallinn University, Estonia.
