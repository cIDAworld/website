IDA World brings together researchers, students and activists interested in furthering the theoretical and practical development of Ideology and Discourse Analysis from a post-structural perspective. The Network was established in May 2003 at the University of Essex and builds upon the Essex Ideology and Discourse Analysis Research Programme, which was first established in 1982 under the intellectual leadership of Ernesto Laclau, and supports MA and Doctoral schemes of study at the Department of Government. 

 Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Marx, Gramsci, Althusser, Saussure, Barthes, Lacan, Zizek, Derrida, Butler, Wittgenstein, Badiou and Foucault, the IDA Programme responded to the growing disenchantment with the dominant theoretical models of social science explanation that dominate the social sciences (e.g. positivism; behaviouralism; structural functionalism; rational choice) by developing a post-structuralist approach to the human and social sciences. 
 
 This approach is grounded on a novel conception of discourse and a corresponding set of theoretical tools for empirical and normative research. Since its establishment, the IDA Programme of research has rapidly expanded. It is the source of a growing number of PhD theses and research projects, attracts foreign visiting scholars on a regular basis, and has spawned related networks and research centre.
