The Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis in the Department of Government at the University of Essex invites you to attend a presentation by Camila Vergara

On the Chilean Social Unrest – A Laclauian Analysis

Discussant: Cristobal Sandoval (Universidad Diego Portales)

This presentation will link the Chilean unrest of October 18th, 2019, to the discussion of important
Laclauian concepts developed in his book On Populist Reason. Looking in particular at the
construction of the people and the antagonistic frontier, this session will analyse how the
Chilean mobilizations have not found a representative, leader, or signifier that embodies the
set of unsatisfied citizen demands and that allows them to be translated into concrete social
policies or an alternative political project.

Date: 18th November 2022

Time: 4.30 - 6pm UTC
