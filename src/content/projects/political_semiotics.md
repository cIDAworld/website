In their book Introducing Relational Political Analysis: Political Semiotics as a Theory and Method (Peeter Selg & Andreas Ventsel; published by Palgrave Macmillan, 2020) they put forth the theoretical and methodological framework for what we call political semiotics. The Tartu-Moscow Schoolâ€™s notion of the semiosphere and the notion of discourse of the Essex School are crucial for that framework. Both are seen as deeply relational or trans-actional conceptions of systems of meaning that is constitutive of political action and social reality in general. The talk is focused on bringing out how these conceptions mutually complement each other for better conceptualization and empirical research of power, governance and democracy as certain articulations of social and political reality.

Peeter Selg is professor of political theory at Tallinn University, Estonia. His main research interests include theories of power, social science methodology, and relational social sciences. Recently, "Introducing Relational Political Analysis: Political Semiotics as a Theory and Method" (Palgrave Macmillan), written with Andreas Ventsel, was published.

Andreas Ventsel is associate professor of semiotics at Tartu University and a lecturer in Pallas University of Applied Sciences in Tartu. His research is interdisciplinary, focussing on semiotics, discourse theory, visual communication, strategic communication, rhetoric and political analysis and especially post-structural political thought. Together with Mari-Liis Madisson he published "Strategic Conspiracy Narratives: A Semiotic Approach" (Routledge) in 2020.
