The Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis in the Department of Government at the University of Essex is delighted to announce a talk by

Joanildo Burity

"Populism, conservatism and public religion in post-impeachment Brazil"

The last decade represented a marked shift in the profile of public religion in Brazil. After three decades of sustained minority engagement, Brazilian conservative evangelicals/pentecostals seized the opportunity to raise their profile an engaged in a majority bid under the double strategy of building a "Christian Majority" discourse and joining a far-right presidential campaign which led to the previous government. This presentation will discuss and analyse the process and its unfolding, including other voices from Christian churches and other religious and secular agents, reflecting on the possible implications for current forms of Christian politics in Brazil. Particular attention will be given to the conceptual characterisation of such developments following a revised Laclauian perspective on populism.

Date: 10 March 2023

Time: 4.30pm

Place: NTC.1.06, University of Essex
