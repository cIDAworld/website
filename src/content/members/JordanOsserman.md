I am a Lecturer in the Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies, where I teach on topics related to psychoanalytic theory and practice, gender and sexuality, and politics. My doctoral research, on the cultural and psychological significance of male circumcision, was published in 2022 with Bloomsbury, [Circumcision on the Couch](https://jordanosserman.com/writing/circumcision-on-the-couch/).
My research interests include feminist, queer and critical theory; Lacanian psychoanalysis; and the politics of the left. I am a member of the Wellcome Trust funded [Waiting Times](https://waitingtimes.exeter.ac.uk) project, and my current research concerns the role of time in the care of young people struggling with questions around gender. I am also actively involved in trade union and renter struggles and have published reflections on these forms of organising from Lacanian and Marxist perspectives.
