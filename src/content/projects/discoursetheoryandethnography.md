**Abstract**

This paper focuses on questions of interdisciplinary exchange regarding methods for collecting research material. The specific focus is on initiating a creative dialogue between political discourse theory (PDT) and contemporary socio-cultural anthropology. The aim is to highlight the need for the extension of the critical work already being undertaken in political discourse theory at the levels of epistemological grounding, theory construction and political analysis, to the practice of doing fieldwork, i.e. the moment of the researcher’s setting off on a journey from the desk to an—always puzzling—out there in the field of research.
