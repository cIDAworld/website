Alicja Rogalska’s latest work documents a metabolic feast, a dinner ritual commemorating the end of humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels. It takes place sometime in the future when humans and their companion species harvest and distribute surplus energy generated by their metabolism and movements.

Around the table, the dinner guests assembled consume fossil fuels and other substances once used in energy production, including coal, crude oil, diesel, lithium and uranium. While doing so, they discuss the strategies employed by society in the past to wean themselves off dirty energy and avert climate catastrophe. Their conversations are inspired by the research of academics from the Faculty of Social Sciences, at the University of Essex.
 
The screening will be followed by Q&A with the artist and a drinks reception.
 
Alicja Rogalksa is an interdisciplinary artist based between London and Berlin. Her practice encompasses research and production with a focus on social structures and the political subtext of daily life. At Essex, she collaborated with a number of academics from the Faculty of Social Sciences, whose research engaged with issues surrounding climate catastrophe, including Professor Jason Glynos, Professor Mark Harvey, Professor Linsey McGoey and Professor Colin Samson.

cIDA seminars host speakers from different disciplinary backgrounds, seeking to offer a forum in which to discuss and engage with current theoretical and political debates.
