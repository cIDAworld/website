Adopting a discourse analytic and psychoanalytic approach to social and political analysis, my research engages broadly with theories of ideology, political economy, and democracy, seeking to delimit a field of investigation I call critical fantasy studies. I am especially interested in the role fantasy can play in helping us understand our affective investment in a wide range of discourses and organizational practices, and to draw out the ideological, political and normative implications of such analyses. The ‘logics approach’ to social and political analysis I have developed with my colleague David Howarth is partly informed by this interest in affect and fantasy, and runs alongside it. A product of sustained engagement with key debates in the philosophy of social science the logics approach operationalizes important insights of the Essex School of Discourse Theory - and poststructuralism more generally - for the conduct of critical empirical research. Grounded in our monograph Logics of Critical Explanation in Social and Political Theory, we argue that this approach helps draw out in a rather forceful way the ideological, political and normative significance of practices.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Jason Glynos","role":"Academic Staff","intro":"","website":"https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/glyno96709/jason-glynos","twitter":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/84742/Glynos.jpg","srcSet":"/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/0ca31/Glynos.jpg 125w,\n/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/e9e8b/Glynos.jpg 250w,\n/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/84742/Glynos.jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/2c9be/Glynos.webp 125w,\n/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/0b151/Glynos.webp 250w,\n/static/954f99c5c40cc049fc66a11b89996fc4/33dd0/Glynos.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/members/jasonglynos"}},"staticQueryHashes":["114927166","2103793815","2997459007"]}
