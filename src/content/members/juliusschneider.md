Julius Schneider is a PhD candidate at the Centre for Ideology and Discourse Analysis, University of Essex. In his research he investigates the rise of the far-right in Germany from a post-structuralist, discourse-theoretical perspective. This perspective enables him to analyse the construction of (far-right) political identities, with a special focus on the role of language and the media. His other research interests lie in theories of political representation, post-colonial theory, post-Marxism, and critical political economy. Juliusâ€™ background is in Political Science (BA, University of Innsbruck) and Political Theory (MA, University of Essex).
