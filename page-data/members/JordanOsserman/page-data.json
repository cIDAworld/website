I am a member of the Wellcome Trust funded <a href=\"https://waitingtimes.exeter.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Waiting Times</a> project, and my current research concerns the role of time in the care of young people struggling with questions around gender. I am also actively involved in trade union and renter struggles and have published reflections on these forms of organising from Lacanian and Marxist perspectives.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Dr Jordan Osserman","role":"Academic Staff","intro":null,"website":"www.jordanosserman.com","twitter":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/aef42/JordanOssermann.png","srcSet":"/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/14dd5/JordanOssermann.png 125w,\n/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/5add7/JordanOssermann.png 250w,\n/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/aef42/JordanOssermann.png 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/2c9be/JordanOssermann.webp 125w,\n/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/0b151/JordanOssermann.webp 250w,\n/static/f80f69045feb3d90085409efc0ad8cef/33dd0/JordanOssermann.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/members/JordanOsserman"}},"staticQueryHashes":["114927166","2103793815","2997459007"]}
