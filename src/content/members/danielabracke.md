Having earned my BA in Cultural studies and Linguistics from TU Dresden (D) and an MA in Conflict, Security and Development from the University of Exeter (UK) I decided to pursue a PhD in Ideology and Discourse Analysis at the University of Essex. In my research project I apply and develop a theory of ‘political semiotics’ drawing on Peeter Selg and Andreas Ventsel’s work. It complements cultural semiotics with poststructuralist discourse analysis to analyse the reconstruction of a linguistic sign upon reception in intercultural communication. Related to this my research interests include de- and postcolonial theories, human rights and identity construction.
